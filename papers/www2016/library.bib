abstract = {Stylistic variation in online social media writing is well attested: for example, geographical analysis of the social media service Twitter has replicated isoglosses for many known lexical variables from speech, while simultaneously revealing a wealth of new geographical lexical variables, including emoticons, phonetic spellings, and phrasal abbreviations. However, less is known about the social role of variation in online writing. This article examines online writing variation in the context of audience design, focusing on affordances offered by Twitter that allow users to modulate a message's intended audience. We find that the frequency of nonstandard lexical variables is inversely related to the size of the intended audience: as writers target smaller audiences, the frequency of lexical variables increases. In addition, these variables are more often used in messages that are addressed to individuals who are known to be geographically local. This phenomenon holds not only for geographically differentiated lexical variables, but also for nonstandard variables that are widely used throughout the United States. These findings suggest that users of social media are attuned to both the nature of their audience and the social meaning of lexical variation and that they customize their self-presentation accordingly.},

abstract = {The style dimension of language variation has not been adequately explained in sociolinguistic theory. Stylistic or intraspeaker variation derives from and.mirrors interspeaker variation. Style is essentially speakers' response to their audience. In audience design, speakers accommodate primarily to their addressee. Third persons - auditors and overhearers - affect style to a lesser but regular degree. Audience design also accounts for bilingual or bidialectal code choices. Nonaudience factors like topic and setting derive their effect by association with addressee types. These style shifts are mainly responsive - caused by a situational change. Speakers can also use style as initiative, to redefine the existing situation. Initiative style is primarily referee design: divergence from the addressee and towards an absent reference group. Referee design is especially prevalent in mass communication. (Sociolinguistic variation, code-switching, bilingualism, accommodation theory, ethnography of communication, mass communication)},

@article{DNMEtAl2012,
abstract = {Understanding social interaction within groups is key to analyzing online communities. Most current work focuses on structural properties: who talks to whom, and how such interactions form larger network structures. The interactions themselves, however, generally take place in the form of natural language --- either spoken or written --- and one could reasonably suppose that signals manifested in language might also provide information about roles, status, and other aspects of the group's dynamics. To date, however, finding such domain-independent language-based signals has been a challenge. Here, we show that in group discussions power differentials between participants are subtly revealed by how much one individual immediately echoes the linguistic style of the person they are responding to. Starting from this observation, we propose an analysis framework based on linguistic coordination that can be used to shed light on power relationships and that works consistently across multiple types of power --- including a more "static" form of power based on status differences, and a more "situational" form of power in which one individual experiences a type of dependence on another. Using this framework, we study how conversational behavior can reveal power relationships in two very different settings: discussions among Wikipedians and arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court.},

abstract = {Traditional mechanistic accounts of language processing derive almost entirely from the study of monologue. Yet, the most natural and basic form of language use is dialogue. As a result, these accounts may only offer limited theories of the mechanisms that underlie language processing in general. We propose a mechanistic account of dialogue, the interactive alignment account, and use it to derive a number of predictions about basic language processes. The account assumes that, in dialogue, the linguistic representations employed by the interlocutors become aligned at many levels, as a result of a largely automatic process. This process greatly simplifies production and comprehension in dialogue. After considering the evidence for the interactive alignment model, we concentrate on three aspects of processing that follow from it. It makes use of a simple interactive inference mechanism, enables the development of local dialogue routines that greatly simplify language processing, and explains the origins of self-monitoring in production. We consider the need for a grammatical framework that is designed to deal with language in dialogue rather than monologue, and discuss a range of implications of the account.},

This paper reassesses the indicators of dominance used in these studies and proposes a framework of analysis that treats dominance as a multi-dimensional construct with sequential, participatory and quantitative aspects. It also attempts to determine a relative saliency among the three dimensions by proposing that sequential dominance, or one speaker's tendency to control the actions of the other speaker within the exchange structure of a conversation, is the most significant dimension on the basis that it is most closely related to topic control. The framework and problems in its application are illustrated with conversational data gathered in a study of Japenese L1 and English L2 conversations between male and female speakers of Japanese.},

We study multi-party conversation in online health communities, which have shown benefits for their members from forum conversations. So far, our understanding of the relationship between alignment in such multi-party conversations and its possible connection to member benefits has been limited. This paper quantifies linguistic alignment in the oldest and the largest cancer online forum. Alignment at lexical and syntactic levels, as well as decay of alignment was observed in forum threads, although the decay was slower than commonly found in psycholinguistic studies. The different pattern of adaptation to the initial post on a thread suggests that specific roles in the online forum (e.g., seeking support from the community) can potentially be revealed through alignment theory and its extensions.},

abstract = {We present a method for extracting so- cial networks from literature, namely, nineteenth-century British novels and se- rials. We derive the networks from di- alogue interactions, and thus our method depends on the ability to determine when two characters are in conversation. Our approach involves character name chunk- ing, quoted speech attribution and conver- sation detection given the set of quotes. We extract features from the social net- works and examine their correlation with one another, as well as with metadata such as the novelâ€™s setting. Our results provide evidence that the majority of novels in this time period do not fit two characterizations provided by literacy scholars. Instead, our results suggest an alternative explanation for differences in social networks.},

@article{Reitter2011,
abstract = {The psycholinguistic literature has identified two syntactic adaptation effects in language production: rapidly decaying short-term priming and long-lasting adaptation. To explain both effects, we present an ACT-R model of syntactic priming based on a wide-coverage, lexicalized syntactic theory that explains priming as facilitation of lexical access. In this model, two well-established ACT-R mechanisms, base-level learning and spreading activation, account for long-term adaptation and short-term priming, respectively. Our model simulates incremental language production and in a series of modeling studies, we show that it accounts for (a) the inverse frequency interaction; (b) the absence of a decay in long-term priming; and (c) the cumulativity of long-term adaptation. The model also explains the lexical boost effect and the fact that it only applies to short-term priming. We also present corpus data that verify a prediction of the model, that is, that the lexical boost affects all lexical material, rather than just heads.},

abstract = {Task-solving in dialogue depends on the linguistic alignment of the interlocutors, which Pickering {\&} Garrod (2004) have suggested to be based on mechanistic repetition effects. In this paper, we seek confirmation of this hypothesis by looking at repetition in corpora, and whether repetition is correlated with task success. We show that the relevant repetition tendency is based on slow adaptation rather than short-term priming and demonstrate that lexical and syntactic repetition is a reliable predictor of task success given the first five minutes of a task-oriented dialogue.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n},

The authors disagree with both conclusions. Various forms of narrative speech samples may be highly correlated, so long as psychologically meaningful, well-validated, and higher order content categories are used. The use of 1st-order content categories is less likely to contribute to the study of personality. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},
